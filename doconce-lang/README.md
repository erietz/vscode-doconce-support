# doconce-lang README

This package provides syntax highlighting for the [doconce markup language](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce). 

This package is at an early state of development. Basic sytax highlighting works fine, but please report any issues in the [github repo](https://github.com/henriasv/vscode-doconce-support).
